        <h5  style=" font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans'; "> <big><big> Meenakshi Temple </big></big> is one of the big and beautiful temples in Tamil Nadu, India. The temple located in the heart of Madurai town. The temple built during the rule of Nayak, who were the famous rulers of Tamil Nadu. Hence the temple has been known as Meenakshi-Sundaraswaran Temple and dedicated to Goddess Meenakshi, the consort of Lord Shiva. Here always fifteen priests served to perform the rituals of the Temple. A large number of Indian and foreign tourists visit this Madura Meenakshi temple daily. For the people of Madurai, the temple is the centre of rich culture and religious harmony among all. Since the Meenakshi Amman temple is one of the greatest ‘Devi’ temples in India and sacred place for the Hindu devotees.</h5>
    
    <h2 style="color: rgb(16, 43, 154); font-family: 'Gill Sans' ;" > <big> The history of Meenakshi Amman </big></h2>
    <h5 style=" font-family: 'Gill Sans' ; font-style: italic;">The Meenakshi Amman temple is dedicated to the couple, Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva. Meenakshi was born out of a sacred fire and had three breasts. Right after her birth, a heavenly voice assured her parents, a Pandyan king, and his wife, that the third breast of their daughter will disappear the day she will meet her husband. 

        Meenakshi grew up to be a great warrior and took over the throne after her father. The ambitious queen went on to conquer multiple adjoining kingdoms. Soon she set out to take possession of the Kailash and met Lord Shiva. At that moment, her third breast fell off, indicating that she had met her husband. The couple came back to Madurai for their wedding ceremony. The wedding was presided over by Lord Vishnu following which the couple ruled the Madurai kingdom, and are still believed to watch over the city and its devotees.</h5>

        <h5 style=" font-family: 'Gill Sans' ; font-style: italic;">The foundation of the temple is believed to have been laid in the 7th century C.E. However, the temple we see today was built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The temple is situated in the centre of Madurai and is spread over 56,700 square meters of land. The entire construction is a well-planned one, and a bird’s eye view depicts a mandala.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(16, 43, 154); font-family: 'Gill Sans' ;" > <big> Significance of Meenakshi Temple  </big></h2>

        <h5 style=" font-family: 'Gill Sans' ; font-style: italic;">The temple is a tribute to the power of a woman and represents the importance of the women in a family. It is a ritual to offer the prayers to Meenakshi before worshipping Sundareswarar. It is also believed that Lord Shiva performed a cosmic dance in the halls of the Sundareswarar shrine. It is in this temple that Shaktism, Vaishnavism and Shaivism form a union.  
            Every year numerous festivals are celebrated in this 2500 years old temple. The Golu festival is a ten-day-long festival, celebrated during the Navratri. Golus or small idols are made that portray the characters of mythological stories. Meenakshi Thirukalyanam is another major festival that rejoices the union of gods and goddesses. 
            <br><br>
            
        <big style="color :rgb(16, 43, 154);"> The Potramarai Kulam </big>
         This is the pond located right in the middle of the temple and considered sacred by the devotees. What makes this water body so special? Well, it is the pond with a golden lotus, which is the direct translation of its name. The pond features a golden lotus in the centre and has no marine life by the benediction of Lord Shiva. 

         <br><br>
           <big style="color :rgb(16, 43, 154);"> The Mandapams </big>
            Mandapams are halls standing on firm pillars, dedicated to many deities. The main purpose was to provide a relaxing place for the pilgrims. Ashta Shakthi, Swamy Sannidhi, Nayaka, Kilikoondu are some major mandapams in the temple arena. 
            
            <br><br>
           <big style="color :rgb(16, 43, 154);"> The Gopurams </big>
           Fourteen massive gopurams surround the entire temple and lead to the shrines. Out of these gateways, five are considered to be the most important. The Nadukattu, Sundareswarar Shrine, Mottai, Chitra, and Kadaka Gopurams are considered as the primary ones. These gateways have a multi-level structure, where each level is adorned with picturesque carvings that describe narratives from the mythology. The southernmost gopuram is the tallest of all, having a height of 170 feet.

To mention a few, there is a nomad woman (kurathi) with four of her children. Even the basket she carries looks like a real one.<pre style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans';">There are lots of mythological stories carved out on pillars. 
Saraswati playing the Veena is a beautiful statue. Five headed snake, Rathi, Purusha Mirugam and the mythical animal Yali are other remarkable ones.
Some of the stones like Rathi on swan emit musical notes when tapped.(There are 1,000 pillar mandaps in Madurai, Tiruvannamalai, Chidambaram, Tiruvarur, Tiruvanaikka, Tiruvarangam and Tirunelveli. 
If all the seven 1000 pillar mandaps are to be rebuilt today it will cost us millions of rupees.  Indians must realise the value of these world wonders and keep them intact for posterity. They are engineering marvels.)</pre>

The Kandariya Mahadeva temple, which is the largest Shaiva shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva was built during the period 1017 – 1029 CE by Vidyadhara, who was the successor of King Ganda. Lord Shiva who is believed to be the Supreme God is also called Mahadeva.


                This temple of Kandariya Mahadeva was built to celebrate Vidyadhara’s victory over Mahmud of Ghazni. He dedicated it to his family deity God Shiva. You can find the epigraphic inscriptions on the pillar of the mandapa, which mentions ‘Virimda’, the pseudonym of Vidyadhara.</h5>

If you observe it carefully, you can see that the temple has a five-part design layout. A torana at the entrance showcases the intricate craftsmanship of the period on the single-stone sculptures. The highlights of the carvings on the stone of tactile quality represents the symmetrical design found everywhere, including the ‘high-relief carvings’ of sculptures. Intricately chiseled sharp inscribed lines exhibit splendid dark-light patterns, as well as strong angular forms, a semblance of the high quality of ornamentation.

            The Red Fort is the largest historical structure in Delhi. Every year, the Prime Minister of India hoists the tricolor flag on every Independence Day. Security around the fort during the Independence Day celebrations is tightened as the place was attacked by terrorists on 22 December in the year 2000. The fort also serves as a major tourist attraction and witnesses thousands of visitors throughout the year. Though many buildings are not in great shape, some are still in good condition and efforts are being taken to conserve what is left of the fort. Three museums namely the museum of blood paintings, war-memorial museum and archaeological museum have been set up inside the fort.In the newly released currency note of rupees 500, the fort appears on the back of the note, implying its importance even in the post-independence era.

       <pre><h5  style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style:italic">Shah Jahan, the then Mughal emperor decided to build the Red Fort as the citadel of Shahjahanabad, his new capital at Delhi. The fort, which was completely constructed in the year 1648.Post the reign of Aurangzeb,
the Mughal dynasty grew weaker in every aspect and that started taking a toll on the fort. When Farrukhsiyar, the ninth Mughal emperor, took over the reign from Jahandar Shah after murdering him, the fort began to lose 
its luster, quite literally. During his reign, the silver ceiling of the fort was replaced with copper in order to raise money. This was probably the beginning of the plunder that would go on for years to come. 
                        
                                    In 1739, Nadir Shah, the Persian emperor defeated the Mughals and took with him some of the valuables belonging to the fort, including the famous peacock throne, which  royal throne of the Mughals. 
The weakened Mughals had no other option but to sign a treaty with the Marathas, who had promised to protect them and the fort. In 1760, when Ahmed Shah Durrani of the Durrani dynasty threatened to capture Delhi, 
the Marathas dug out the silver ceiling of Diwan-i-Khas to strengthen their army. However, Ahmed Shah Durrani defeated the Marathas in the third battle of Panipat and took over the fort. 
                            
        The Marathas reconquered the fort in 1771 and stalled Shah Alam II as the 16th Mughal emperor. In 1788, the Marathas occupied the fort and ruled over Delhi for the next 20 years before the British defeated them 
during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803.The fort now was occupied by the British, who even built a residence of their own within the fort. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, Bahadur Shah II, was arrested by the
British and later exiled to Rangoon. With Bahadur Shah II, the Mughal Empire came to an end and this opened a window of opportunity for the British to loot valuables from the fort.
                            
        Almost all furniture were either destroyed or shipped to England. Many edifices and landmarks within the fort were destroyed and barracks of stone replaced them. Many priceless possessions like the Koh-i-Noor 
diamond,the crown of Bahadur Shah  British government. After independence, the Indian Army occupied a major part of the fort before handing it over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASA) for restoration purposes.

The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect.

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic; color: #4a038d; ">Architecture Of the TAJ MAHAL</h2>
    <h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb variety. The tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended beyond the square at the corners. The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of the southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed by the portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of the tomb is square in plan, with chamfered corners. <pre style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">                    The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. The exquisite octagonal marble lattice both cenotaphs is a workmanship. 
It is highly polished and richly decorated with inlay work. The borders of the frames are inlaid with precious stones representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. The hues and the shades of the stones used to
make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal is in perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated with inlaid flower plant motifs.
The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later by the side of the latter on its west.The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb,
a practice adopted in the imperial Mughal tombs.</pre>
<h5  style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
    The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.</h5>

                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). 
            </li type="1">
            <li>
                The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”.

            <li>
                It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                    The only exception is the tomb of Sahah Jahan which was added later to the building. There is a story which suggest that Sahah Jahan was planning on building a replica of the Taj Mahal for himself on the other side the river, though no evidence or plans of this has ever been found.

               <li  type="1">
                   Sahah Jahan was overthrown by his own son and imprisoned in the Red Fort within sight of the Taj Mahal. He was forced to spend the last eight years of his life in prison till his death in 1666.

    <h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">The Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence (house). It is located in Mysore, Karnataka. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.</h5>

    <h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. </h5>

            <li type="1">
                In 1793 AD, when Tipu Sultan took over the Wodeyar Dynasty, he demolished the palace and rebuilt it. In 1799, soon after the death of Tipu Sultan, the palace came under Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, who redesigned the palace as per the Hindu architectural style.
                           </li>
            <li type="1">
                It is believed that Yaduraya Wodeyar, the first ruler of the Mysore Kingdom, built a palace in Puragiri aka the Old Fort during his reign.
            </li>
            <li type="1">
                This palace, which is believed to be the predecessor of the current palace, has been demolished and reconstructed multiple times over a period of six centuries.

            </li>
            <li type="1">
                Initially, the palace was a wooden fortress which was struck by lightning in 1638 and reconstructed under the rein of Kantirava Narasa Raja Wodeyar.

            <li type="1">
                Of the seven palaces that dot the cityscape of Mysore, this royal edifice is the most splendid one. The palace had its foundation laid way back in the 14th century by the Wodeyars or Wadiyars, the royal family of Mysore.

                Sadly, in 1897, the palace was destroyed by fire during the wedding ceremony of Princess Jayalakshmmanni. Again, Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi and her son Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV decided to rebuild the palace.
            </li>
            <li type="1" style="motion: ;">
                The task of revamping the palace was commissioned to a British architect named Henry Irwin, who designed and completed this palace in 1912, at a whopping cost of over 41 lakh Indian rupees.
            </li>
       <li type="1">
        Further expansions were done and a Public Durbar Hall wing was added to the palace under the reign of Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar during the 1930s.

        <h5  style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;"> Mysore Palace is built in the Indo-Saracenic style with a touch of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic architectural styles. The three-storied palace along with a 145 feet five-storied tower was built using fine grey granite while deep pink marble was used for the domes. The exterior of this marvelous structure is enriched with two durbar halls, several arches, canopies, columns and bay windows. There is also a sprawling green garden surrounding the palace. The interiors are opulently designed with carved doors, stained glass ceilings, glittering glazed flooring tiles, spectacular Czechoslovakian chandeliers, and works of art from all over the world. All the rooms of the palace are stunningly luxurious and quite appealing.

            Above the central arch, there is a divine sculpture of Gajalakshmi – the goddess of wealth with two elephants. In addition to the three entrances, located on the eastern, southern, and western sides, the palace features several secret tunnels. There is also a group of temples at the palace, built from the 14th to the 20th century.

            The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar,
is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, 
which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded
by the Tomar Rajputs.It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret 
of Jam in Afghanistan, which was constructed a decade or so before 
the probable start of the Delhi tower.The surfaces of both are elaborately
decorated with insrptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a 
shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under  balconies" 
at the top of each stage.In general, minarets were slow to be used in
India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist. 
                    The Qutb Minar serves as a central marker to these 
new Muslim communities as well as being a reminder of Islam's presence
in the area.The Qutb Minar is seen as the "earliest and best example of a
fusion or synthesis of Hindu-Muslim traditions" according to Ved Parkash 
in his essay The Qutb Minar from Contemporary Near Contemporary Sources. 
Like many mosques built in South Asia during this time period, the 
minaret was constructed by Hindu laborers and craftsmen but overseen by
Muslim architects. </pre></h5>

    The height of Qutb Minar is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks. The tower tapers, and has a 14.3 metres (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to 2.7 metres (9 feet) at the top of the peak. It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.</h5>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
The whole tower contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps. At the foot of the tower is the Quwat Ul Islam Mosque. The Minar tilts just over 65 cm from the vertical, which is considered to be within safe limits.
</h5>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
Qutb Minar was an inspiration and prototype for many minarets and towers built. The Chand Minar and Mini Qutub Minar bear resemblance to the Qutb Minar and inspired from it.The Qutb Minar consists of five stories of red and grey sandstone. The lowest story, also known as the basement story, was completed during the lifetime of Ghiyeth al-Din Muhammad, a sultan during the Ghurid dynasty.
</h5>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
It is revetted with twelve semicircular and twelve flanged pilasters that are placed in alternating order. This story is separated by flanges and by storied balconies, carried on Muqarnas corbels.[14] The story is placed on top of a low circular plinth that is inscribed with a twelve-pointed star with a semicircle placed with each of the angles between the star’s points.

<h5 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
There are also six horizontal bands with inscriptions inscribed in naskh, a style of Islamic calligraphy, on this story. The inscriptions are as follows: Quran, sura II, verses 255-60; Quran, sura LIX, verses 22-23, and attributes of God; The name and titles of Ghiyath al-Din; Quran, sura XLVIII, verses 1-6; The name and titles of Mu’izz al-Din; and Qur’anic quotations and the following titles in this much restored inscription: "The Amir, the most glorious and great commander of the army."

       <pre style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: larger;">       Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said  square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati.
However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear. As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the 
entire city immensely during that era. <br>
                It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah.  <br>

        <h5 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; " >
        The inscription on the foundation stone is translated as ‘Fill this my city with people as, Thou hast filled the river with fishes, O Lord.’ This also indicates that the monument was built to mark the city’s foundation as well. As per the historian Historian Mohammed Safiullah, Charminar was built as an epicenter of Hyderabad.
        The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years with a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakhs huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen down after being struck by lightning. It was then repaired at a cost of around Rs.58000 then. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost of Rs. 2 lakhs.
        There is another legend associated with the Charminar according to which, there is a secret underground tunnel that connects Charminar to the Golconda Fort. It was built for the royal family, to escape in case of any kind of emergencies. However, till date no tunnel could be found.

            <li>
                The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam.
            </li>
            <li>
                 195  The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece. The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Towards the north of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction. 170  Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.

            </li>
            <li>
                Historian Masud Hussain Khan says that the construction of Charminar was completed in the year 1592, and that it is the city of Hyderabad which was actually founded in the year 1591.

            <li>
  
                According to the book "Days of the Beloved", Qutb shah constructed the Charminar in the year 1589, on the very spot where he first glimpsed his future queen Bhagmati, and after her conversion to Islam, Qutb Shah renamed the city as "Hyderabad". Though the story was rejected by the historians and scholars, it became popular folklore among the locals.

in the four corners of the building. They rise to almost 48.7 meters from the ground and overlook the landscape of the area. Charminar is square shaped and minarets have four levels
with level circled by a ring around the minaret. The four arches of the building face four main directions and each side is opened to a huge courtyard. The arches have a width of 11 
meters and a height of 20 meters from the base. <br><br>
                    The balcony in the first floor provides an excellent view of the surrounding areas and on the top floor, there is a small mosque which is  the Western side of the

more people for Friday prayers.There is a verandah at the eastern portion of this space with a huge open arch. <br>
        Though it is the perfect epitome of Shahi architecture, there are clear elements of Hindu architecture visible on this monument. In the arches and domes, Islamic architecture 
is explicit and the ornamentation is primarily Hindu style. Constructed using granite and lime-mortar, the floral designs and water screens enhance the monument's beauty and elegance.
It also offers excellent view of the Golconda Fort which reiterates the glorious times of Hyderabad when it was under the reign of Qutub Shahi and the Golconda rulers. </pre> </b></h5>

    <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;  font-size: medium;" > Fatehpur Sikri is a city near Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Its construction was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Akbar. It served as the imperial capital before it was shifted to Lahore. A series of structures were built predominantly using the locally quarried red sandstone (called Sikri sandstone) including palaces, gateways, tombs, mosques etc. in the new city by the Emperor.</h4> <br>

<h4 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-size: medium;" >
        Akbar was spiritually inclined to the Chishti Sufi order which strengthened after Shaikh Salim Chishti predicted the birth of Akbar’s eldest son Salim and future Emperor Jahangir. In gratitude, Akbar ordered the construction of his capital at Sikri, where his pir, Shaikh Salim resided.
    </h4> <br>

    <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;  font-size: medium;" >
        The construction at Sikri commenced in 1569, the year of Jahangir’s birth. Initially, a religious compound for Shaikh Salim was built which included a khanqah (hospice) and a mosque, Jami Masjid, the largest mosque at that time. A colossal southern gate called Buland Darwaza was added to the religious compound to commemorate Akbar’s successful campaign in Gujarat in 1573. From then on, Sikri became Fatehpur Sikri or the City of Victory. After Shaikh Salim’s death in 1572, an all white marble tomb was constructed in the compound with intricate and ornamental jali work. It was completed in 1580-1.

        From 1571, the construction of a walled city and an imperial palace had begun in Sikri. Like Humayun’s Tomb was constructed near Nizamuddin Auliya’s tomb, Akbar’s palace at Sikri was constructed near Shaikh Salim’s khanqah, establishing proximity with the Chishtis to derive legitimacy for his rule.
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Diwan-i-Aam or Public Audience Hall, a pillared flat-roofed veranda where Akbar used to meet nobles and common people alike to hear their grievances.
            </li>
            <li>
                Diwan-i-Khas or Private Audience Hall where the Emperor held private meetings with nobles. This is a unique structure because in the centre of the chamber stands a pillar, elaborately carved with an imposing capital composed of serpentine brackets. The pillar supports a circular platform connected to each corner of the building atop which stone slabs rest. Most likely, Akbar sat on the central platform projecting himself as the central figure of the realm.
                Anup Talao which is a square shaped pool with a pavilion in the centre whose base is connected with each corner of the pool's edges through walkaways. It’s said Akbar used to hold religious discussions with the ulema regarding the Islamic law.

        Akbar did not just give orders for the construction of imperial palaces but his new capital at Sikri comprised of noble’s residence, a huge mosque, serais, bazaar, gardens, baths, schools, and workshops, thus serving as a holistic royal, administrative, economic and residential complex.</h5>

    <h5 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: 500; font-size: medium;" >Fatehpur Sikri architecture exhibits both Muslim and Hindu architectural influences. You can see a glimpse of Rajasthani style in the Jodha bai mahal. It has used the windows from where Jodha bai used to watch Tansen playing his music to resemble the one that can be seen in the forts and Mahal all-around Rajsthan. You can find some examples of Gujarati style as well.

        The complete city of Fathepur Sikri is built using red sandstone except for the tomb of Salim Chisty which is built using white marble, just like the one you see in Tajmahal. The Mahals and buildings such as 5 mahals, Diwan-I-Khas, and Diwan-I-Am were built using Vastu sastra. Small walls in these places are because of Vastu only, not due to the fact that Akbar was short in height.
        
        The city was originally rectangular in shape, with a grid pattern of roads and by-lanes that cut at right angles, as well as effective drainage and water management system. The city’s administrative block, royal palaces, and Jama Masjid are all located in the city center. The buildings are made of red sandstone with little marble.

 Backside of the grand gateway of Jodha Bai Mahal, the largest residential complex in Fatehpur Sikri. Some of the important buildings in this city, both religious and secular are:
        
Buland Darwaza: Set into the south wall of congregational mosque, the Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri is 54 metres (177 ft) high, from the ground, gradually making a transition to a 
human scale in the inside. The gate was added around five years after the completion of the mosque c. 1576-1577 as a victory arch, to commemorate Akbar's successful Gujarat campaign. 
It carries two inscriptions in the archway, one of which reads: "Isa, Son of Mariam said: The world is a bridge, pass over it, but build no houses on it.

                        The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen". The central portico comprises three arched entrances, with the largest one, 
in the centre, is known locally as the Horseshoe Gate, after the custom of nailing horseshoes to its large wooden doors for luck. Outside the giant steps of the Buland Darwaza to the 
left is a deep well.
                      Jama Masjid: It is a Jama Mosque meaning the congregational mosque and was perhaps one of the first buildings to be constructed in the complex, as its epigraph 
gives AH 979 (A.D. 1571–72) as the date of its completion, with a massive entrance to the courtyard, the Buland Darwaza added some five years later. It was built in  manner of Indian 
mosques, with iwans around a central courtyard. A distinguishing feature is the row of chhatri over the sanctuary. There are three mihrabs in each of the seven bays, while the large
central mihrab is covered by a dome, it is decorated with white marble inlay, in geometric patterns.

                Tomb of Salim Chishti: A white marble encased tomb of the Sufi saint, Salim Chishti (1478–1572), within the Jama Masjid's sahn (courtyard). The single-storey structure 
is built around a central square chamber, within which is the grave of the saint, under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with mother-of-pearl mosaic. Surrounding it is a covered 
passageway for circumambulation, with carved Jalis, stone pierced screens all around with intricate geometric design and an entrance to the south. The tomb is influenced by earlier 
mausolea of the early 15th century Gujarat Sultanate period. Other striking features of the tomb are white marble serpentine brackets, which support sloping eaves around the parapet.
       
        On the left of the tomb, to the east, stands a red sandstone tomb of Islam Khan I, son of Shaikh Badruddin Chishti and grandson of Shaikh Salim Chishti, who became a general 
in the Mughal army in the reign of Jahangir. The tomb is topped by a dome and thirty-six small domed chattris and contains a number of graves, some unnamed, all male descendants of
Shaikh Salim Chishti.

        Diwan-i-Aam: Diwan-i-Aam or Hall of Public Audience, is a building typology found in many cities where the ruler meets the general public. In this case,it is a pavilion-like
multi-bayed rectangular structure fronting a large open space. South west of the Diwan-i-Am and next to the Turkic Sultana's House stand Turkic Baths. </pre></h5>

        The Gateway of India Today
    </h2>
    <h5 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
      

Today the Gateway of India is one of Mumbai’s top tourist attractions, and is a gathering spot for locals and vendors. The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India. While the Gateway is symbolic of colonial subjugation, it also evokes a sense of cultural identity and belonging to those in Mumbai, which can be paradoxical to some. The architecture of the Gateway helped shape the skyline of Mumbai, as Islamic, British, and Indian motifs can be seen in the architecture of buildings surrounding the site today.

   <h5 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;  "  >The gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the Delhi Durbar of 1911; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India. However, they only got to see a cardboard model of the monument, as construction did not begin until 1915. The foundation stone for the gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet for the gateway sanctioned in August 1914.

    Before the gateway's construction, Apollo Bunder used to serve as a native fishing ground. Between 1915 and 1919 work continued at the Apollo Bunder to reclaim the land on which the gateway was to be built, along with the construction of a sea wall. Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the gateway. Its foundations were completed in 1920 while construction was finished in 1924. The gateway was opened to the public on 4 December 1924 by the then viceroy, Rufus Isaacs.</h5>

        <pre>                                   The Gateway of India was designed by Scottish architect, George Wittet and the construction work was carried out by Gammon India Limited, the only
construction company in India boasting an ISO 9001: 1994 accredited certification in all fields of civil engineering at that time. The structure was built with yellow basalt stones 
enmeshed with reinforced concrete at the foundations. The stone was sourced locally.The perforated screens were brought from Gwalior. The structure cuts an angle to the road leading 
to it and stands facing out to the Mumbai Harbor from the tip of Apollo Bunder.

                        The structure is basically a Triumphal Arch, built predominantly in an Indo-Saracenic architectural style with some Muslim elements incorporated. This style of 
architecture was introduced by the British during their rule in India and it combines diverse elements of the Hindu and Muslim architecture with Gothic cusped arches, domes, spires,
tracery, minarets and stained glass, in a uniquely playful style.
        
        The rectangular structure consists of three sections. The central arches of the structure are 85 feet high. The central block houses a dome which is 48 feet in diameter and 83 
feet in height. On each side of the arch, there are large halls with arches that are covered with intricately carved stone screens and can hold 600 people each. The central dome is 
joined by 4 turrets and is decorated with intricate latticework, the most prominent features of the entire structure of the Gateway of India.

            Steps from behind the arch of the Gateway lead directly into the Arabian Sea.

            The arch frames an impressive view of an expanse of Arabian Sea dotted with fishing boats as well as luxury yachts. The structure is illuminated after nightfall presenting 
a breathtaking view in combination with the adjacent Taj Mahal Palace hotel and tower. A statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji was inaugurated on 26 January 1961, opposite the gateway as a 
symbol of Maratha pride and glory. Another statue of Swami Vivekananda is  present in vicinity to celebrate his journey from Mumbai to Chicago for the Parliament of World Religions. </pre></h5>

<h2 style=" font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: #4a038d;">History And Architecture</h2>



<h5 style=" font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; "> <ul>
    <li>
        Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of the great Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh who built Jaipur, constructed the Hawa Mahal in 1799. 
    </li>
    <li>
        He was so impressed with the Khetri Mahal built by Maharaja Bhopal Singh in the town of Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan that he embarked on constructing the Hawa Mahal that today stands as a remarkable gem of Rajput style of architecture. It was built as an extension of the Royal City Palace and leads to the zenana or women's chambers.
    </li>

    <li>
        One of the main reasons of constructing this beautiful mahal decorated with fine lattice windows and screened balconies was to facilitate the royal Rajput women, who otherwise followed the strict Purdah system and refrained from appearing in public, in  getting a glimpse of the daily events, royal processions and festivals taking place on the streets.
    </li>
    <li>
        This way they could enjoy their sense of freedom while maintaining their customs. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The architect of this unique five-storied pyramidal palace with a height of 15 m from its elevated base was Lal Chand Ustad. The design of the building showcases an excellent blend of Hindu Rajput architecture with that of the Islamic Mughal architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
        The former style is palpable from the fluted pillars, floral patterns and domed canopies while the arches and stone inlay filigree work are manifestations of the latter style.
        
    </li>
    <li>
        Keeping in line with other famous landmarks of the city, which is aptly tagged as the ‘Pink City’, this monument was built with red and pink sandstones.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh’s devotion towards Lord Krishna is manifested from the design of the structure of the palace that resembles the crown of the Lord. Although not exactly a palace, it looks like one from the street. The façade of the building intricately carved with beautiful motifs is cognate to that of the honeycomb of a beehive.
    </li>
    <li>
        Several potholes of the structure each having small lattice windows, chiselled sandstone grill and decorated domes give the building a look of a mass of semi-octagonal bays. There are a total of 953 elaborately carved jharokhas or windows, some of which are made of wood.
    </li>
    <li>
        These jharokhas were build in such a manner that air circulates naturally through them creating Venturi effect (doctor breeze) thus air conditioning the entire structure during the hot summers. Each jharokha has a small chamber where one can sit and view the street. Fountains at the middle of each chamber complimented well with the light wind flowing through the jharokhas thus enhancing the cooling effect of the chambers.

An imperial door from the city palace side 
leads to the entrance of the Hawa Mahal. Three two-storied buildings enclose a large courtyard on three sides with the Hawa Mahal located on its eastern side. The courtyard presently houses an archaeological museum. 
The interior of the mahal consisting of chambers as also passages and pillars leading to the top storey is however quite plain and simple compared to the ornamented exterior.The width of the top three storeys is that of a
single room while the first two storeys have courtyards. There are no stairs in the building and top storeys can be reached only by ramps.
